```

A population of fish we're interested in has four life stages: eggs (E), fry (F), juvenile (J), breeding adult (A). You are told that annually:

- Each breeding adult will produce, on average, 600 eggs
- 5% of eggs will survive to become fry
- 20% of fry will survive to become juveniles
- 16% of juveniles will survive to become adults
- Adult survival rate year to year is 90%

Recall the Leslie matrix from EDS 212. Matrix multiplication (using the dot product `%*%` of the matrix with the populations at each life stage) yields the population structure at the following year. 

### Create the Leslie matrix:

```{r}
# Make the Leslie Matrix: stage survived to the next cycle
fish_leslie <- matrix(c(0, 0, 0, 600, 0.05, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.20, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.16, 0.9), nrow = 4, ncol = 4, byrow = TRUE)

# Check it out: 
fish_leslie
```

The initial population structure is given by: 
```{r}
# Initial population structure (Roe, Fry, Juvenile, Adult): 
fish_year0 <- c(5000, 8000, 600, 400)
```


Add line-by-line comments wheres prompted in the code below, explaining what each is doing. Make sure that you are talking with your neighbors about what is really being created at each step. 

```{r}
# Model projections

# ------ WHAT HAPPENS HERE? ------ #
# ------ comment line-by-line ---- #

# The line below... stores a sequence of year starting at 0 going to year 8 in increments of 1
time_yr <- seq(from = 0, to = 8, by = 1)

# The line below... creating a matrix that has fish population in the columns and the rows have year || making a placeholder matrix, once we go through our iteration, it will be populated
proj_year <- matrix(ncol = length(fish_year0), nrow = length(time_yr))

# The line below... this is showing how the points will be plotted || putting in the first row as the initial row, we had an existing vector of the intial condition, put that inital condition to the first row (we use row, column)
proj_year[1, ] <- fish_year0

# The for loop below...2:___ it's the seq at 2, putting in the rest of the year || why is she starting at 2? it's cause the first row already had the population, what are you looping over? starting at fish leslie, take the dot product of that matrix taking OUT the previous years data, taking the dot product with the inital year what comes out of that is the vector of the i-th row... what row is getting populated -> row 2
for (i in 2:length(time_yr)) {
  proj_year[i,] <- fish_leslie %*% proj_year[i-1,]
}


# The rest is wrangling & visualization (run to check it out): first line, renames the columns, second line she binds together proj_year w/ time_year, colaps everything
colnames(proj_year) <- c("eggs", "fry", "juvenile", "adult")

proj_df <- data.frame(time_yr, proj_year) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -time_yr, names_to = "lifestage", values_to = "stage_population")

ggplot(data = proj_df, aes(x = time_yr, y = stage_population)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = lifestage)) +
  scale_y_log10()

```

Test different combinations of survival / reproduction and starting population structures to see what happens!
